### US State Game: Guess the States!

This Python project is an interactive game built using the Turtle Graphics library, where players try to name all the U.S. states. When the game starts, players are presented with a blank map of the United States, and their goal is to correctly guess each stateâ€™s name.

For each correct guess, the state's name is displayed at its corresponding location on the map. Players can keep guessing until they've named all 50 states or decide to end the game by typing "Exit." If they choose to exit early, the game records any states they missed, allowing them to review and learn later.

This game is a fun and educational way to test U.S. geography knowledge and improve recall of state names!
